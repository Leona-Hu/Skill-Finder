SpaceX was founded under the belief that a future where humanity is out exploring the stars is fundamentally more exciting than one where we are not. Today SpaceX is actively developing the technologies to make this possible, with the ultimate goal of enabling human life on Mars.DYNAMICS SOFTWARE ENGINEERAs a member of the Integrated Dynamics Analysis group, you will design, develop, and maintain analytical and data management tools associated with structural dynamics analysis. These analyses involve complex and recurring processes that can be computationally expensive. You will be responsible for the complete lifecycle of the software you create, from development to testing to deployment to the dynamics engineering team. Be prepared to join a challenging and exciting work environment where your work will directly contribute to SpaceX’s commercial, manned, and Mars missions.RESPONSIBILITIES: BASIC QUALIFICATIONS:PREFERRED SKILLS AND EXPERIENCE:ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:ITAR REQUIREMENTS:SpaceX is an Equal Opportunity Employer; employment with SpaceX is governed on the basis of merit, competence and qualifications and will not be influenced in any manner by race, color, religion, gender, national origin/ethnicity, veteran status, disability status, age, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, mental or physical disability or any other legally protected status.Applicants wishing to view a copy of SpaceX’s Affirmative Action Plan for veterans and individuals with disabilities, or applicants requiring reasonable accommodation to the application/interview process should notify the Human Resources Department at (310) 363-6000.
