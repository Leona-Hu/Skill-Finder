Whether those needs are paid time off, medical expenses, prescription drug expenses, cash disbursement, or a combination of any of these, the IBA provides flexibility to help you meet your specific goals. The IBA can be used for such things as:IBA Benefits accrue each month in the amount equivalent to 50% of the employees monthly compensation rate. That is, the effective dollar amount of this accrual is in addition to an employees salary. The PSP is a qualified retirement plan that Northstrat funds semi-annually on the employees behalf through the IBA in the amount equivalent to 25% (up to the IRS contribution limit) of the employees compensation. That is, of the 50% accrual in the IBA, half of the amount accrued is applied to the PSP.Because Northstrat is an employee-owned company, all new employees are offered stock options. Employees have the opportunity to receive additional stock options based on accomplishment of individual performance goals. Stock owners elect the Board of Directors and are directly impacted by the success of the company.Northstrat does not mandate specific working hours. Although project requirements may dictate schedules, a Northstrat employee is only required to work an average of 8 hours per weekday over the course of a month. For example: John worked 12 hours on June 1st to meet a project deadline. On June 15th, John only worked 4 hours because he left early for a long weekend. Johns IBA was not debited for time off because flex time allowed him to carry over those 4 hours from June 1st. Northstrat is an Equal Opportunity Employer All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, veteran status or other characteristics protected by law.
