We need heroes to help us imagine the future of the World of Warcraft, both in terms of our technical vision, and the gameplay that it supports. We're dedicated to building new and interesting ways to play, collaborate, and interact within the Warcraft universe, and we're looking for engineers to join our team and help build those new features.We value diversity on our team, as well as a healthy work-life balance, and we strive to staff appropriately to meet both those goals.  We recognize that the best ideas and most creative work come from a safe and well-rested workforce, and we endeavor to protect that.The world of Azeroth is a big place, so this is no small challenge, but we have a great team of friendly faces waiting to help you along the way.  If you have the skills and experience, as well as the passion and excitement, we hope you’ll apply. ResponsibilitiesRequirements PlussesRequired Application Materials
