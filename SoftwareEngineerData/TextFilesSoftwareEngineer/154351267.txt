MROi implementation is divided into four software releases with capabilities to plan, schedule and execute organic depot maintenance processes within the commodities, electronics, missile and propulsion maintenance groups. MROi replaces dissimilar legacy systems and processes used across numerous geographic locations with a common enterprise business system that optimizes resource and workload assignments, facilitates what- if planning and frees-up logistics capacities aimed at improving capabilities availability to the warfighter. MROi operates within a Defense Information System Agency (DISA) hosted environment and interfaces with various legacy systems to support continuous operations within the depot maintenance environment.PRIMARY FUNCTION:Develops, researches, designs, implements, tests, and evaluates software and systems, in conjunction with hardware product development, that enable computers to perform their applications, applying principles and techniques of computer science, engineering, and mathematical analysis.
