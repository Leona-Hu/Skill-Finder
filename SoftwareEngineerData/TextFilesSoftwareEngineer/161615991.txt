The Senior Systems Engineer supports our domestic and international product development business. Nature of Role: Reporting to the Head of Systems Engineering, the Senior Systems Engineer is responsible for various systems engineering functions within multiple projects. The main objectives are to ensure proper translation of user, caregiver and a variety of additional stakeholders’ needs into clearly defined, verifiable design inputs. Collaborate with project teams to define system solutions, architectures (design outputs) and interface requirements between various subsystems to adequately meet the design inputs. Additional activities include determining the essential requirements necessary to drive initial concept development, leading systems architecture concept development sessions, and creating ratings criteria for concept ranking, prioritizing the development strategy and acceptance of early architectural concepts. Act as the hub of the product development team by engaging all engineering disciplines (including but not limited to Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Software Engineering architects) to organize system architectures and product development activities. Parallel activities will include translating the early research findings and regulatory requirements into functional requirements with documented rationales, intended to be measurable and verifiable or validated at later stages. Late stage activities include advising on formal verification plans in collaboration with Design Assurance Engineers for risk assessments and assisting with test method development. The role will also require incorporation of directly related standards and regulatory requirements. Responsibilities:  Requirements:  An individual holding a bachelor’s degree in a related field, coupled with minimum of 8 years of experience within the product development industry. Familiarity with related standards and medical device development is a plus. Experience with typical industry requirement management systems is a plus. Our fast-paced environment demands the ability to manage multiple projects within the discipline and deadlines. High-energy, self-starters with the following qualities:
