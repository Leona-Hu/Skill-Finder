“Dedicated to creating the most epic entertainment experiences…ever.”    That’s our mission statement here at Blizzard Entertainment, and for an art tools engineer on the World of Warcraft (WoW) team, it’s a way of life.    In this role, you’ll improve existing (and create new) tools that will enable some of the most talented artists in the world to ply their craft freely and directly. As such, you must be proficient in developing powerful programs for art creation pipelines.    The WoW team is built on a culture of collaboration, intense creativity, and problem-solving. As a group, we are committed to pushing our exploration of Azeroth to the fullest, and in doing so creating a gaming experience like no other. As an art tools engineer, the work you do will live at the very heart of this philosophy. We’re looking for an engineer with qualities above and beyond engineering. We want a person that enjoys working in a group setting; who speaks artist and geek with equal fluency, and whose experience in creative environments has reinforced the value of communications, empathy, and knowledge sharing.  ResponsibilitiesRequirementsPluses
