Doing this while delivering a delightful experience to all of our users is a challenge we relish.We also been able to balance these stringent requirements with our desire to be agile and productive through intelligent abstractions, investments in our infrastructure, and our affinity for functional programming and static typing.We believe in transparency and operate as a group of peers who respect ideas, talent, and initiative.We have an engineering strategy session once every few weeks where we realign our priorities and map out milestones for all our initiatives.Work with another engineer and our business team to automate the process of matchmaking our incoming streams of Asks and Bids.Build out our new API, which allows wealth management platforms to integrate with our platform, enabling more users to get exposure to pre-IPO investments, or to get liquidity on their holdings.Setup a system to allow us to manage our outbound email campaigns, advertising spend, and transactional email to help more users convert to transacting customers.Set up a sophisticated security permissions and audit logging system which will let us keep track of all mutations happening on our systems, letting us move quickly without having to be concerned about data leaks or admin mistakes.ScalaPostgreSQLPythonGraphQLReactRedisAkkaVue.jsTypeScriptKubernetesDockerGoogle CloudClojureFunctional languages
