Who are you, Workstate?Workstate is a technology consulting company, built by technologists, for technologists. Throughout our 20-year history weve been on a mission to create the best home for people who love to build. Who are we? Were builders.How we build.At Workstate, building doesnt just apply to technology.We apply it to everything we do -- building relationships, skillsets, retirement accounts, technical knowledge, music collections, recipe files, dad joke collections, movie recommendations, travel logs, childhood toy recollections and more. So much more. We build to last.But, the technology...No matter what were building, the technology forms the backbone of all our projects. Were not purists, though. We choose the technology to fit the circumstance; we dont force the circumstance into a preferred tech stack. We love to build, and we love to learn new ways to build. In any given project, you may find yourself working with:A comprehensive list would be impossible. Containers? Got em. Machine Learning? That pops up, too. And, so on.Our CultureWe love building. We get to build all day at work. Therefore, we love coming to work. But we emphasize home, family and personal time as essential to overall well-being. This is reflected in our benefits:Are we for you?We like it here, but we recognize were not for everyone. Were not just here to write code. Were here to build lasting relationships with delighted clients. This requires strong interpersonal skills, a collaborative mindset, organizational savvy, and a talent for circumventing and resolving conflict. This is not to say that we expect everyone to have these skills fully developed upon hire. If the thought of developing and utilizing these skills is appealing, then we might be for you.What else, what else, what else...What else? Our headquarters is across the street from the historic North Market, at the intersection of the Short North and Downtown Columbus. Were a five minute walk from Nationwide Arena. Oh, and we have free parking for all our employees, also available over the weekend and after hours.We have a catered team lunch in our office every Friday where people working at a client site converge with people working in the office to reconnect, swap stories, and talk about what theyve been doing.We throw a pretty enjoyable, family-friendly, year end party. The past few years weve rented out a party tower at Nationwide Arena for a hockey game.Convinced?Why not apply using the button below. Have questions? Drop us a line at hello@workstate.com.
