Sema4 is a patient-centered health intelligence company founded on the idea that more information, deeper analysis, and increased engagement will improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. Sema4 is dedicated to transforming healthcare by building dynamic models of human health and defining optimal, individualized health trajectories, starting in the areas of reproductive health and oncology. Centrellis™, our innovative health intelligence platform, is enabling us to generate a more complete understanding of disease and wellness and to provide science-driven solutions to the most pressing medical needs. Sema4 believes that patients should be treated as partners, and that data should be shared for the benefit of all. Sema4 is searching for a talented Data Scientist to join our Disease Discovery team in Stamford, CT. The candidate will work in a multi-disciplinary team in Sema4 and contribute significantly to our efforts to systematically study complex human diseases through the integration of genomic, genetic, epigenetic, proteomic, literature and clinical phenotypic data into network models or other machine learning models. The goal of this research is to identify and model mechanisms underlying human diseases using computational models such machine learning, deep learning, or other artificial intelligence techniques. Such models will be used to guide drug target discovery and prioritization, to develop combination therapies, to reposition existing drugs, to match individual patients to the best therapies, and more. Responsibilities Requirements:
