Come join a well funded and rapidly growing team at the center of AI, Cloud, and Open Source as we build our US sales, account management, and partnerships teams. Who are you?You are a revenue-oriented relationship builder who can identify a golden partnership opportunity and bring it to fruition, but also knows when to walk away. You are tenacious but not pushy, you bring credibility but also empathy. You are a self starter, and have the confidence to push into the unknown without any promise of success. You have a track record of success in sales, operations, channel partnerships, customer success, or account management at a software company. You are analytical and use data to make decisions on where to spend time and money. You should be driven by a strong desire to build and maintain relationships with happy customers and help them solve their problems. An understanding of data science would be really nice, but is not a must-have as we can teach you what you need to know. Additional languages beyond English are a bonus. A healthy sense of humor is also always appreciated. Whats the job?In a nutshell your job is to recruit, enable, and cosell with partners. Ensure that partners are happy and successful, and that their customers increase adoption of KNIME over time. You will be the main contact for a portfolio of partners and will work together with our Data Scientists and Solution Engineers to understand their clients needs, help with evaluations, negotiate contracts, and hand off happy clients to our customer success team. Were looking for someone to join us in Austin, Texas at our US HQ, although remote candidates may be considered. Title and compensation dependant upon experience.Who are we?KNIME Inc is the Gartner Leader for Data Science and Machine Learning Platforms. Recently having closed a $20M Series A of funding, we have disrupted the machine learning and artificial intelligence space with an open source model that allows for massive adoption and usage of the platform at no cost to data scientists while monetizing certain enterprise and team functionality. We are being used by many of the worlds largest companies from Pharmaceuticals to Telecom to Energy to Government. However, we are most proud of the consistently high marks we get for user satisfaction and the way that we are helping the worlds greatest organizations to make better decisions faster.
