At PathAI, we are using machine learning to diagnose disease accurately and to match patients with effective therapies. We develop and apply computational methods to integrate data across biological scales (population, patient, tissue, cellular, molecular and genomic) to define disease states and to predict therapeutic response.  Data Science and biostatistics play central roles in this effort. We are looking for a Data Scientist to lead these efforts at PathAI.Responsibilities QualificationsBenefitsFor the right candidate, we'll offer a competitive salary plus equity. Your compensation is rounded out by a strong benefits package:Most importantly, you'll be doing important work with a team of people you'll genuinely enjoy spending the day with. Apply through our website:
